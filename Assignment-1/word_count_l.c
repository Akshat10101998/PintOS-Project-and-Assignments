  Explanation of list_entry():
  ============================
  
  #define list_entry(LIST_ELEM, STRUCT, MEMBER) ((STRUCT*)((uint8_t*)&(LIST_ELEM)->next - offsetof(STRUCT, MEMBER.next)))

    1. Here first it finds the address of (LIST_ELE)->next
    2. Then, the size of items till MEMBER.next is substracted from the above found adress using offset function in c
    3. adress is then type casted into unint8_t
    4. A struct pointer points to the adress which is the adress of the parent struct.

  Explanation of list_insert():
  ==============================

      Function Definiton:
        void list_insert(struct list_elem* before, struct list_elem* elem) {
                  ASSERT(is_interior(before) || is_tail(before));
                  ASSERT(elem != NULL);

                  elem->prev = before->prev;
                  elem->next = before;
                  before->prev->next = elem;
                  before->prev = elem;
                }

    
      A list with two elements in it looks like this:


        +------+     +-------+     +-------+     +------+
    <---| head |<--->|   1   |<--->|   2   |<--->| tail |<--->
        +------+     +-------+     +-------+     +------+
  
  
    Inserting a new element:
      
      else if ((wc = malloc(sizeof(word_count_t))) != NULL) 
        {
          wc->word = word;
          wc->count = 1;
          struct list_elem *e = list_begin(wclist);
          e = list_next(e);
          list_insert(e, &wc->elem); 
                             
        }

        1. We need to pass the new element created and a before element
           Here, the new element created is the one which pointer wc points at and before element is head.next.next (item 2 in the diagram)
        
        2. Necessary rearrangements of prev and next pointer as shown in the above code, to insert the new element between 1 and 2.

  
        +------+     +-------+     +------------+      +-------+     +-------+
    <---| head |<--->|   1   |<--->|new element |<---> |   2   |<--->| tail  |<--->
        +------+     +-------+     +------------+      +-------+     +-------+
